                Welcome to the Doge Sound Club (DSC), a friendly community that
                embraces creativity and collaboration through the use of
                generative Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and an open-license
                approach.
                <br />
                <br />
                Doge Sound Club is centered around the concept of &quot;Doge 
                Sound,&quot; which playfully refers to nonsensical jokes and
                sayings, known as &quot;Gaesori&quot; in Korean. The term 
                &quot;Doge Sound&quot; derives from the Korean words 
                &quot;Gae&quot; (meaning dog) and &quot;Sori&quot; (meaning 
                sound), signifying lighthearted, entertaining conversations.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our project started in July 2021 with the launch of Korea&apos;s 
                first generative NFTs called Doge Sound Club Mates. These unique 
                digital collectibles form the basis for our membership activities 
                and foster a sense of belonging within the community.
                <br />
                <br />
                DSC is committed to fostering a creative environment where 
                everyone can contribute, regardless of their background or skill 
                set. We believe in the importance of an open-license approach, 
                ensuring that our stories and content are available for anyone to 
                use and build upon without restrictions.
                <br />
                <br />
                To support our open-license philosophy, all DSC content follows 
                the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) 
                license, unless otherwise stated. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Our community members are encouraged to create and share their 
                work using a variety of mediums, such as writing, drawing, or 
                coding. To facilitate this collaborative process, we use Git, a 
                version control system that allows for seamless cooperation and 
                the continuous development of our collective stories.

                TOY DAPP
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                At Doge Sound Club (DSC), we also develop Toy Decentralized Applications 
                (Toy DApps) to make blockchain technology more accessible and enjoyable 
                for everyone, regardless of their knowledge about the blockchain. These 
                playful dApps may not have specific utility, but they provide a fun, 
                engaging experience for users.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of our popular Toy DApps is the Doge Sound Contest. This competition 
                combines blockchain technology with a Discord bot to host a monthly 
                contest where participants submit their best &quot;Doge Sound&quot; 
                entries. Doge Sound refers to nonsensical jokes and sayings, known as 
                &quot;Gaesori&quot; in Korean. DSC community members vote for the most 
                illogical and unpredictable submissions to select a winner.
                <br />
                <br />
                The winning Doge Sound is then showcased on the main page of our 
                website. Winners also have the opportunity to mint their Doge Sound as 
                an NFT by clicking a button connected to the smart contract.
                <br />
                <br />
                The idea behind hosting this unique contest is rooted in our 
                project&apos;s fiction. The DSC community believes that the world is a 
                simulation, and that inconsistent or unpredictable sayings and actions 
                often cause bugs in the simulation. These bugs serve as clues that the 
                world is a simulation. To encourage the discovery and exploration of 
                these bugs, we&apos;ve been running the Doge Sound Contest on the Klaytn 
                blockchain since 2021.
                <br />
                <br />
                By developing and promoting Toy DApps like the Doge Sound Contest, DSC 
                aims to create a fun and inclusive environment for users to engage with 
                blockchain technology, fostering curiosity and creativity within our 
                community.

                <br />
                <br />
                Our ultimate mission at Doge Sound Club is to create a world where 
                everyone can be a creator, unrestricted by licensing barriers or other 
                limitations. We aim to make it easy for ordinary people to express their 
                creativity and contribute to a shared universe of stories and 
                experiences.
